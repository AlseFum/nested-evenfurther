# Nested even further
You can write your own nested design and deploy with this repository.

This repository uses vite+vue, thus you need node to launch it.

As for how to write the design, you can just look at the `src/assets/example.js`, or just read the code. It's not complicated.
;-)

and remember to change `base` in vite.config.js
